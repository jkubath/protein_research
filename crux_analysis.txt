Main app: crux-toolkit-master/crux-main.cpp
  line 69 calls TideIndexApplication()

TideIndexApplication: crux-toolkit-master/TideIndexApplication::main starts at line 44
  var_mod_table is created at line 85: src/app/tide/modifications.h
      holds all the modifications to the variables like [O+25]
    modifications.h
      constructor
        calls sort() at line 99
          n * log(n), but is called in a for loop 256 times
  TideIndex starts at line 166
  fastaToPb is called at line 172 heap sorted by mass then peptide lengths
    uses ifstream to read the .fasta file
      for loop is used to iterate character by character to find the protein id
      protein sequence is added line by line until the next '>' is found
      write the protein data to file
      line 494 GeneratePeptides::cleavedPeptides pushes all possible peptides to a vector
        crux-toolkit-master/GeneratePeptides.cpp line 308
          two for-loops is n^2 for each protein sequence
      for-loop iterates over all the peptides
          calls calcPepMassTide(): crux-toolkit-master/TideIndexApplication line 760
            adds h2_O mass and for loop to iterate each amino acid
          add the peptide target to outPeptideHeap in log time: TideIndexApplication line 514
    For-loop iterates over the set of peptide sequences: TideIndexApplication line 537 or line 584
      generateDecoys: TideIndexApplication line 938
        if decoys have already been generated for this sequence
          add them to the decoySequences vector
        else
          if duplicates aren't allowed, it adds the decoys to a set first, then copies
          all the data to the decoy vector
            TideIndexApplication line 1000
        add all the decoys to the outPeptideHeap
  output the proteins to a file

  read all the proteins - ReadRecordsToVector
    HeadedRecordReader
      RecordReader
        google::protobuf::io::CodedInputStream
          google::protobuf::io::FileInputStream
            filename and buffer size = -1 (appropriate value)

    while loop for all the proteins in the protein heap
      if there are duplicates for the current peptide
        add all the locations to a pbAuxLoc vector

      write the duplicate locations
        app/tide/protobuf/peptides.proto
        list of auxiliary locations
          protein id (index in the heap), start protein position
      write the peptide information
        id, mass, length, protein id first location, position

TideSearchApplication: src/app/TideSearchApplication.cpp
  read all the proteins from the index (database)

  use multi threading for the peptide search: TideSearchApplication.cpp line 1105
    array of mutex will lock the data to make it atomic

    array of thread_data objects are held
      src/app/TideSearchApplication.h line 257

      lines 189 - 229 do the same thing other than one line in two if statements

      multiple copies of the same data
      spectra are loaded in line 318
        sorted by MZ
      search called on line 337
        ObservedPeakSet.preprocess is used to normalize peptides app/tide/spectrum_preprocess.h
          remove peptides outside of given ranges or set the max intensity of intensity
        collectScoresCompiled - creates programs to evaluate the dot product for all peptides
          results are saved in match_arr2 declared on line 605


Improvements
  eliminating objects made when functions are called
  sorted heap is used when inserting peptide objects and called again before writing

Read all the proteins from the database
generate all the peptides for all the proteins
  sorted by mass and length
for all the observed proteins
  find the database peptides that are within the same window as the current spectrum
    saved in active_peptide_queue.queue_ (private variable)
  calculate dot product for similarity comparisons
  keep the top scores to later be given a confidence value
