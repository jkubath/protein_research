TideSearchApplication: src/app/TideSearchApplication.cpp
  read all the proteins from the index (database)

  use multi threading for the peptide search: TideSearchApplication.cpp line 1105
    array of mutex will lock the data to make it atomic

    array of thread_data objects are held

        collectScoresCompiled - creates programs to evaluate the dot product for all peptides
          results are saved in match_arr2 declared on line 605


Improvements
  eliminating objects made when functions are called
  sorted heap is used when inserting peptide objects and called again before writing
  break peptides into smaller files
    store the windows held in each file in a outline file
    only open the smaller files needed not the entire peptide file

Read all the proteins from the database
generate all the peptides for all the proteins
  sorted by mass and length
for all the observed proteins
  find the database peptides that are within the same window as the current spectrum
    saved in active_peptide_queue.queue_ (private variable)
  calculate dot product for similarity comparisons
  keep the top scores to later be given a confidence value

In this approach, the user must preprocess a given protein database to produce a binary
protein database and a binary peptide index. The preprocessing step sorts all of the
peptides in the database by mass and stores pointers to their locations in the protein database
(sequence index, start position, and peptide length). Crux can then quickly retrieve a set of
candidate peptides via a simple range query on the peptide index. Upon execution, Crux
accesses the binary protein database and the peptide index as memory-mapped files. This
approach offloads to the operating system the decision about how much of the database
to store in memory, ensuring that small databases are read fully into memory but large
databases are paged into and out of memory only as needed.
  This flatness indicates that the running time for retrieving candidate
  peptides is dominated by the fixed cost associated with scanning the file from disk.

Peptides are in a binary file by mass
these peptides are searched list of peptides inside the spectrum window are returned
these peptides have position links back to the protein binary file
