<h3>How to use branches in SVN</h3>

<p>
This guide is meant to be a cheat sheet for working with branches in
SVN in the crux project.  For a more detailed discussion, please see
this <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04.html">tutorial
</a>.  </p>

<p>
We will create a new branch of crux named "side-project", move its
changes into the trunk, and finally merge changes in the trunk into
"side-project".  We will use <code>$SVNROOT</code> to mean the root of
the crux module in the SVN repository.  On the <code>gs</code> network, it will
be <code>file:///noble/svn/crux</code> and on remote
machines <code>svn+ssh://&lt;hostname&gt;/noble/svn/crux</code>.  All  
the work will happen in <code>~/sandbox</code> and the current
working directory will precede the cursor in the example commands as
in <br><code>~/sandbox&#36; svn co $SVNROOT/trunk crux</code>


<h4>Creating a branch</h4>
<p>
A branch is just a copy of the trunk.  By convention, we keep branches
in the <code>$SVNROOT/branches</code> directory of the repository.
You can create a branch without having a working copy.  After copying,
check out your new branch.  For this example, we'll check out into a
directory named <code>crux-side-project</code>.</p>
<pre>
~$ svn cp $SVNROOT/trunk $SVNROOT/branches/side-project -m "Create a new branch for a side project."
~$ cd sandbox
~/sandbox$ svn co $SVNROOT/branches/side-project crux-side-project
~/sandbox$ cd crux-side-project
</pre>

<p>
Your branch and the trunk are now identical.  Now you can work in your
branch as you would in the trunk, making changes and checking them in
at regular intervals.  Even though it is not required for checking in
changes to your branch, have your code checked frequently so that your
reviewer doesn't have to tackle huge differences.</p>  

<h4>Merging</h4>
<p>
Merging in either direction (trunk to branch or branch to trunk)
involves these basic steps: 
<ol>
<li>Get a clean working copy of the files into which you will merge changes.
<li>Find the point of divergence.
<li>Have SVN merge changes into a working copy.
<li>Edit any changes SVN could not merge automatically.
<li>Test your working copy.
<li>Commit the changes with an appropriate log message.
</ol>

<h4>Merge a branch into the trunk</h4>
<p>
When you are ready for "side-project" to be part of the release
version of crux, you will want to merge those changes into the trunk.

<ol>
<li>
Get a clean copy of the trunk.  It is MUCH easier to undo mistakes if
there are no changes in your local copy.  Either check out
a clean copy or do <code>svn update</code> on an existing check
out to make sure all new files have been added and all existing files
are up to date.
<pre>
~/sandbox$ svn co $SVNROOT/trunk crux-trunk
~/sandbox$ cd crux-trunk
~/sandbox/crux-trunk$ svn status -u
Status against revision:   3522
</pre>
<li>
Check the svn log to find the revision where the branch was created.
Using <code>--stop-on-copy</code> ends the log where the branch began.
<pre>
~/sandbox$ svn log --stop-on-copy $SVNROOT/branches/side-project
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r3389 | frewen | 2010-06-10 01:44:54 -0700 (Thu, 10 Jun 2010) | 1 line

Create a new branch for a side project.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
In this case we will merge the changes starting with r3389.  If you
have already synced this branch with the trunk, look for the most
recent entry describing the merge.  For example
<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r3437 | frewen | 2010-06-29 10:09:20 -0700 (Tue, 29 Jun 2010) | 8 lines

Merged trunk changes into the side-project branch.  Merge command was

svn merge -r3389:HEAD <svnroot>/crux/trunk

where HEAD was 3436.  Smoke and unit tests all pass.  This version
of the branch will now be merged into the trunk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
In this case, begin the merge with r3437.  For the rest of the
example, we'll use r3389.</p>

<li>
Merge the branches.  This command only changes your working copy;
there will be time to fix things before committing to the repository.
Use the <code>--dry-run</code> option first to see what changes will take place.
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-trunk$ svn merge --dry-run -r3389:HEAD $SVNROOT/branches/side-project
~/sandbox/crux-trunk$ svn merge -r3389:HEAD $SVNROOT/branches/side-project
</pre>                             

<li>
Resolve any conflicts.  See below for more details.

<li>
Build and test your newly merged working copy.  This step is
essential.  You don't want to check in a broken version of crux.

<li>
Check in your changes with a detailed note describing the merge.  
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-trunk$ svn commit -m 
  'Merged side-project branch into trunk -r3389:HEAD where head was 3522.  Adds a new utility, crux-do-stuff.'
</pre>

<li>
If you are done with your branch, you can delete it.  Remember that
deleted branches can be resurrected just like any other file or
directory in SVN.  If you want to continue working in the branch,
bring it up to date with the trunk as described in the  next section.

</ol>

<h4>Merge the trunk into branch</h4>
<p>
Moving changes from the trunk into the branch is much the same as
merging in the other direction.  In this case your local working copy will
be checked out from the branch.  The changes to merge will start at
the same revision (in the example r3389). The HEAD revision (r3523) of the
trunk now contains all of the changes in the branch since r3389. We
don't want to apply those changes to the branch again, so we merge from
r3521, one version before the branch-to-trunk merge. After merging in
both directions, you can check that the trunk and the branch are, once
again, identical.  
</p>
<pre>
~$ cd ~/sandbox
~/sandbox$ svn co $SVNROOT/branches/side-project crux-side-project
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ cd crux-side-project
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ svn merge -r3389:3521 --dry-run $SVNROOT/trunk
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ svn merge -r3389:3521 $SVNROOT/trunk
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ ./bootstrap
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ ./configure
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ make
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ cd src/c/test
~/sandbox/crux-side-project/src/c/test$ make
~/sandbox/crux-side-project/src/c/test$ cd ~/sandbox/crux-trunk
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ svn commit -m 'Merged the trunk into the side-project branch, -r3389:3521.  Branch and trunk are now identical'
</pre>


<h4>Resolving conflicts</h4>

<p>
Often SVN cannot decide how to combine the changes from two versions
of crux, resulting in a conflict.  The output from the following merge
commands shows two different kinds of conflicts.
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ svn merge --dry-run -r3437:HEAD $SVNROOT/trunk 

--- Merging r3438 through r3534 into '.':
C    src/c/match_collection.cpp
C    src/c/q-value.cpp
C    src/c/objects.h
U    src/c/crux-utils.h
U    src/c/peak.h
   C src/c/q-ranker.h
   C src/c/percolator.cpp
A    src/c/test/smoke-tests/params/ppm_window
D    src/c/woops.txt
Summary of conflicts:
  Text conflicts: 3
  Tree conflicts: 2
</pre>

<p>
Output lines beginning with 'U', 'A', or 'D' indicate all is well.
The file will be updated, added, or deleted.  Lines with a 'C' in the
first column indicate a text conflict: SVN can't decide on the
contents of the merged file.  A 'C' in the third column indicates a
tree conflict: both trunk and branch added or deleted the same file
and you must choose which addition/deletion to accept.</p>

<h5>Interactive conflict resolution</h5>
<p>
When you do the real merge, you are presented with a prompt for each
text conflict. 
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-side-project$ svn merge -r3437:HEAD $SVNROOT/trunk 
Conflict discovered in 'src/c/q-value.cpp'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
        (s) show all options:
</pre>

<p>
Type 'e' to edit the file and fix the conflict.  An editor will open
up with the file in question.  Search for '===' or '<<<' to find the conflict.
<pre>
<<<<<<< .working

  DECOY_XCORR_QVALUE,  ///< q-value derived from empirical null (decoys)
  DECOY_XCORR_PEPTIDE_QVALUE,

=======
  DOTP,                ///< not yet implemented
  LOGP_EXP_SP,         ///< this spot hijacked for zscore
  DECOY_XCORR_QVALUE,  ///< Benjamini-Hochberg q-value from xcorrs
  LOGP_BONF_EVD_XCORR,
  LOGP_WEIBULL_SP,
  LOGP_BONF_WEIBULL_SP,
>>>>>>> .merge-right.r3534
</pre>

The branch version is between "<<<<<<< .working" and "=======".  The
trunk version is between "=======" and ">>>>>>> .merge-right.r3534".
You can edit the file however you want, selecting either the top block
or the lower block or some combination of the two.  Make sure you
remove the "<", ">", and "=" lines.  It can be helpful to have clean
copies of the branch and the trunk checked out for reference.  Using a
side-by-side editor such as xxdiff with the pre-merged files can be helpful.
Once you resolve this conflict,
    keep searching the file for more.  When you are done, save the
    file and quit the editor.  You will be greeted with this prompt.
<pre>
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit, (r) resolved,
        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
        (s) show all options: 
</pre>

<p>
Type 'r' to mark the conflict as resolved.  The merge command will
continue.  If you find a conflict that you don't know how to fix, exit
the browser and type 'p' at the prompt.  This leaves the file marked
as having a conflict.  You can examine the differences in more detail
after the merge command is finished.  

<p>
After merging, check the status.
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; svn status
?       src/c/match_collection.cpp.working
?       src/c/match_collection.cpp.merge-left.r3437
?       src/c/match_collection.cpp.merge-right.r3534
C       src/c/match_collection.cpp
!     C src/c/q-ranker.cpp
      >   local delete, incoming delete upon merge
!     C src/c/q-ranker.h
      >   local delete, incoming delete upon merge
</pre>

<h5>Conflict resolution after the merge</h5>
<p>
In this example, we didn't resolve the conflict
in <code>match_collection.cpp</code> and SVN has left us several
different versions of the file.  The file with the original name is
the one we looked at in the editor.  It contains whatever merges svn
could manage plus the &lt;&lt;&lt; / === / &gt;&gt;&gt; blocks with
alternate versions. The ".working" file is what we had locally before
the merge: the branch version at the HEAD revision.  The ".right" file
is the trunk version at the HEAD revision.  We can compare ".working"
and ".right" side-by-side to help decide what the final version should
be and make the changes in "match_collection.cpp".  I like to use
<code>xxdiff</code> because I can compare all three files and edit and
save with the changes highlighted.  Or you could use the command
line <code>diff</code> with the --side option to view the changes and 
edit "match_collection.cpp" separately.  Sometimes <code>svn
diff</code> in the branch and/or the trunk is useful for understanding
how the file changed.

<p>
Once "match_collection.cpp" is the way you want it, mark it as
resolved.  Note that you can compile and test the code before you
resolve the conflict.
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; svn resolve --accept working src/c/match_collection.cpp
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; svn status
!     C src/c/q-ranker.cpp
      >   local delete, incoming delete upon merge
!     C src/c/q-ranker.h
      >   local delete, incoming delete upon merge
</pre>

<p>
Now only the tree conflicts remain.  (<code>svn resolve</code> removed
the other versions of match_collection.cpp.)  Tree conflicts most
often happen when a file with the same name is added in a branch and
the trunk. The history of only one of those files can be saved and SVN
doesn't know which to choose.  Check the contents of the two files and
the log entries for the two files and decide which you want to keep.
Often, they are similar enough that it doesn't matter.  You can always
put a note in the commit log explaining the conflict.  In the example
above, both the branch and the trunk deleted the same file, so it
really doesn't matter whose change to accept.  Use <code>svn
resolve</code> again.  The three most common values to use for 
<code>--accept</code> are 'working' (whatever is in the local working 
copy), 'mine-full' (whatever was in the branch version of the
repository), 'theirs-full' (whatever was in the trunk version of the
repository).  Unless you have made local changes (say, to a file being
added), 'working' and 'mine-full' are the same. 
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; svn resolve --accept working src/c/q-ranker.cpp
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; svn resolve --accept working src/c/q-ranker.h
</pre>

<h5>Undoing changes</h5>
<p>
If you bungle things and want to start over, use svn revert to restore
the file to its pre-merge state. (Note that this works because there
were no local changes when we started merging.) Then repeat the merge
with the single file. 
<pre>
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; svn revert src/c/match_collection.cpp
~/sandbox/crux-side-project&#36; cd src/c/
~/sandbox/crux-side-project/src/c&#36; svn merge -r3437:HEAD $SVNROOT/trunk/src/c/match_collection.cpp
</pre>
