<h1>The change-review-commit cycle</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
If you are reading this document, you may be new to the crux
development team.  Welcome!  The following is an outline of a typical
work cycle.  If you are a seasoned programmer, it will give you an
idea of how we combine our versioning system (Git) with
our code review process.  However, it is written with the junior
developer in mind with useful tips for folks who may not be accustomed
to working on a multi-person project.  The outline is also 
sprinkled with links to more details of the various components of the
process.  We strive to keep our documentation current and complete.
If you find something unclear or out-of-date, don't hesitate to update
this page or others.

<h2>Prepare your working copy</h2>

<li>
To begin work on crux, you will need a copy of the code base.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">Clone</a> a clean clean 
copy from the
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit">GitHub repository</a>
or update your existing
working copy.  Some changes can be made directly in the trunk, but if
you are working on something experimental or sufficiently complicated,
you can create a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch">branch</a>, do
your work there, and later merge your changes into the trunk.

<li>
Run <code>git pull</code> to make sure you are beginning with an
exact copy of what is in the repository.

<li>
<a href="using-cmake.html">Build</a> crux and run the 
<a href="crux-tests.html">tests</a> to make sure everything is working
before you start.

<h2>Implement your changes</h2>
<li>
This is the part you already know how to do.  Edit or add files.
Build and test frequently.  Consider adding new 
<a href="crux-tests.html">smoke or unit tests</a> for your new
functionality or bug-fix.  Remember to follow the 
<a href="crux-coding-standards.html">coding standards</a>.

<h2>Prepare for your code review</h2>
<li>
When you are ready for a <a href="code-review.html">code review</a>, do a
final build and test to see that everything is working.

<li>
Run <code>git status</code> to see the list of files that changed and
to confirm that you added any new files to Git.

<li>
Run <code>git pull</code> to obtain any changes in the upstream repository.
If necessary, run <code>git merge</code>, resolve conflicts, build, and test.

<li>
From the root of the crux project, run <code>git diff &gt;
my-changes.diff</code>.  Give <code>my-changes.diff</code> a
short meaningful name, for example new-column.diff.  Look it over to
make sure it has only those changes you intended. (* see below for
notes on <a href="#branches">code review in branches</a>)

<li>
Ask someone on the development team to do a code review for you and
send him or her the diff file.

<li>
Make any changes suggested by your reviewer.  Build, test, and prepare
another diff file, repeating the cycle until you and your reviewer
have agreed on the set of changes.

<h2>Check in your changes</h2>
<li>
Commit your changes to the repository with <code>git commit</code>.
Add a short, descriptive comment including the name of your reviewer.
For example, "Added a new column, myscore, to the output of
search-for-matches.  Code reviewed by Bill."
Follow this with <code>git push</code> to send your commit to the GitHub 
repository for Crux.

</ol>

<h2>Notes on branches</h2>
<p>
If you are working in a branch, you can change the review cycle
slightly.  When you are ready for a code review, you may check your
changes into the branch and point your reviewer to it.  Give him or
her the name of the branch and the versions to compare for the
change.  For example, "My changes are in crux/branches/thestuff.  See
-r5444:5466 for the relevant changes".  In a branch, the code need not
be fully functional when it is reviewed.  For example, if you are
creating a new class, the first review may be just of the header file
defining the new class.  It's more important that your reviewer be
given manageable amounts of change than that you finish everything
before someone sees it.
</p>

<h2>Notes on simultaneous changes</h2>
<p>
You may have several small projects you are working on at once which
you want reviewed separately.  There are two possible approaches.  You
may put all the changes in one working copy and have them reviewed and
checked in separately.  For example, if you are writing some helper
functions in crux-utils.cpp to be used later, you could prepare those
files for review separately and check them in separately.
<pre>
$ git diff src/c/crux-utils.cpp src/c/crux-utils.h /src/c/test/unit-tests/check-crux-utils.c > helper.diff
$ git commit -m 'Added a do_cool_stuff() to crux-utils. Reviewed by Bill' src/c/crux-utils.cpp src/c/crux-utils.h /src/c/test/unit-tests/check-crux-utils.c
</pre>
<p>
More often than not, the two projects will overlap and it's easier to
keep two working copies.  In that case, you might implement
do_cool_stuff() and send it off for review.  Then while you are
waiting, check out a clean copy and start working on your next
project.  When the code review comes back, commit the crux-utils
changes and then you can even delete that copy.  Do <code>svn
    update</code> in the new project to pick up the crux-utils
changes.
