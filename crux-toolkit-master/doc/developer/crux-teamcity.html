<h2>Managing the Crux TeamCity Server</h2>
We use
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>
to provide continuous integration services for Crux.
Charles Grant, Rita Chupalov, and Bill Noble are the 
administrators for our server.
<h2>Accessing the TeamCity Server</h2>
Our TeamCity server runs on <code>noble-web</code>,
and it is only accessible from machines behind the Genome Sciences' firewall.
A local user account named <code>teamcity</code> is used to control the
TeamCity server.
<h3>Accessing the TeamCity Server Using the Command Line</h3>
To log on to nrhel6-x64:
<ol>
<li>Log on to a computer beind the GSIT firewall.</li>
<li>Run <code>ssh nrhel6-x64</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo su - teamcity</code> 
(you may need to have GSIT add you to the sudo list for this command).</li>
</ol>
The binaries and supporting scripts for TeamCity will be found in the
<code>bin</code> subdirectory in the TeamCity home directory:
<code>/data/TeamCity</code>.
<h4>Controlling the TeamCity Server</h4>
The main reason to access TeamCity using the command line 
is to start or stop the server.
To start the TeamCity Server run the command:
<pre>
bin/runAll.sh start
</pre>
To stop the TeamCity Server run the command:
<pre>
bin/runAll.sh stop
</pre>
<h3>Accessing the TeamCity Server Using the Web Interface</h3>
Most administrative chores for the TeamCity server are more easily
accomplished using the TeamCity web interface.
If you are on a computer behind the GSIT firewall:
<ol>
<li>Have a TeamCity administrator create a TeamCity account for you.</li>
<li>
Open the URL <code><a
href="http://nhrel6-x64.gs.washington.edu:8111">http://nhrel6-x64.gs.washington.edu:8111</a></code>
in your browser.
</li>
<li>
Log in using the credentials for your TeamCity account.
</li>
</ol>
If you are not on a computer behind the GSIT firewall the process is a little
more complex.
You have to establish a TCP/IP tunnel from your computer, through the firewall,
and on to nhrel6-x64.
If your system supports the <code>ssh</code> command:
<ol>
<li>
Establish a tunnel using the command:
<pre>
ssh -f -N -L 8111:nrhel6-x64.gs.washington.edu:8111 cegrant@nexus2.gs.washington.edu
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Open the URL <code><a
href="http://localhost:8111">http://localhost:8111</a></code>
in your browser.
</li>
<li>
Log in using the credentials for your TeamCity account.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The TeamCity Build Agents</h2>
TeamCity uses build agents to build Crux on multiple platforms.
We currently run build agents on the following machines:
<p/>
<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Machine</th><th width="30%">Platform</th><th
width="40%">Directory</th><th width="10%">User</th></th>
</tr>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>nrhel6-x64</td>
  <td>64-bit and 32-bit Linux</td>
  <td>/data/TeamCity/buildAgent</td>
  <td>teamcity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>nwin7-x64</td>
  <td>64-bit and 32-bit Windows</td>
  <td>C:\BuildAgent</td>
  <td>cegrant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Charles's Mac</td>
  <td>OS X</td>
  <td>/Users/cegrant/buildAgent</td>
  <td>cegrant</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p/>
The 64-bit Linux agent runs on the same virtual machine as the TeamCity server,
and runs as the <code>teamcity</code>user. 
Use the command
<pre>
sudo su - teamcity</code>.
</pre>
to switch to the <code>teamcity</code> user.
You may need GSIT to add you to the sudo list for this command. 
The other agents are currently run as <code>cegrant</code>,
but can be run by anyone in the <code>noblelab</code> group.
<p/>
The agents are not configured to start automatically when the host boots.
You'll need to login and manually start them.
To start an agent, navigate to the <code>buildAgent</code> directory
on the host and run
<pre>
bin/agent start
</pre>
The agents can be shut down by running
<pre>
bin/agent stop
</pre>
It can take three or four minutes for an agent to start and connect to the
TeamCity server.
<p/>
To connect to the Windows build agent you'll need to use a Windows Remote
Desktop Client (RDC) and your GSIT user name and password.
If you are connecting from a machine beyond the GSIT firewall you'll need to
set up tunneling through the firewall:
<pre>
ssh -f -N -L 3389:nwin7-x64.gs.washington.edu:3389 cegrant@nexus2.gs.washington.edu
</pre>
Then, when starting the RDC, use <code>127.0.0.1</code> as the remote address.
<p/>
The OS X Agent is currently running on the Mac Pro laptop on Charles's
desk. Contact him if you need access.
