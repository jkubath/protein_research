<h3>Modifications in Crux</h3>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: This document is describing modifications
  as they were originally implemented in Crux (src/util/modifications.h;
  src/util/modifications.cpp). They have since been re-implemented
  (src/model/Modification.h; src/model/Modification.cpp), though the original
  implementation is still in use in a few places (such as
  src/util/peptide_modifications.cpp and the legacy parameter code).</p>

<p>The following is an explaination of the code that handles
  differential sequence modifications.  These are the changes to amino
  acid masses that occur on some residues of some peptides.  At the
  bottom of the page are the <a href="#original_reqs">original
  requirements</a>.</p>

<p>The user specifies in the parameter file what modifications should
  be considered.  The three possible options are mod, amod, cmod.  The
  'mod' option is for modifications that may occur anywhere on the
  peptide.  The 'nmod' and 'cmod' options are for position-specific
  modifications, i.e. they occur on either terminus of the peptide.
  Each mod three values: the mass change, the residues on which the
  modifcation may occur, and the maximum number of times that
  modification may appear in one sequence.  For example, to consider
  up to phosphorylations on residues S, T, or Y, the user would
  include this line in the parameter file.
mod=79.9:STY:2
Positional mods have only two values: the mass change and the maximum
  distance from the terminus.

<p>Each 'mod' option given by the user is stored as an amino acid mod
  or AA_MOD_T with the following definition:
<pre>
struct AA_MOD_T{ 
  double mass_change;  ///< the amount by which the mass of the residue changes
  BOOLEAN_T aa_list[AA_LIST_LENGTH];
                       ///< an array indexed by AA, true if can be modified
  int max_per_peptide; ///< the maximum number of mods per peptide
  MOD_POSITION_T position; ///< where the mod can occur in the pep/prot
  int max_distance;        ///< the max distance from the protein terminus
  char symbol;         ///< the character to represent the mod in sqt files
  MODIFIED_AA_T identifier; ///< the bitmask assigned for unique ID
};
</pre>
The first three values are those as given by the user.  'position'
corresponds to the option name: mod is ANY_POSITION, nmod is N_TERM
and cmod is C_TERM.  Max_distance is only relevant to positional
N_TERM and C_TERM type mods.  Each amino acid mod is given a unique
symbol for textual representation (e.g. '*', '#', '@') and a unique
bitmask identifier.  More on that later.  In parameter.c there is a
list of AA_MODs which is created as the parameter file is parsed and
remains unchanged for the duration of execution.  

<p>
Peptide sequences were originally stored only as pointers into
character arrays held by protein objects.  We choose to store
modification information for each peptide in an array of unsigned
ints, type deffed as MODIFIED_AA_T.  The unsigned int store the value
of the amino acid 
in the least significant bits.  The values 0-25 represent residues
A-Z.  This leaves the remaining 11 bits to be used as flags for each
possible AA_MOD.  For this reason, there is a maximum of 11
modifications that can be given by the user.  The unique identifier
for each AA_MOD can be used to set or check its assigned bit in the
MODIFIED_AA_TNote that a single residue can have as many as 11
different modifications but cannot have more than one instance of a
given type of modification. 

<p>
A peptide can have more than one AA_MOD applied to it, either on one
residue or on several residues.  In the simple example above, a
peptide could have either 0, 1 or 2 phsporylations.  The combination
of AA_MODs applied to a peptide is called a peptide modification or
PEPTIDE_MOD_T.  It has the following definition.
<pre>
struct PEPTIDE_MOD_T{
  double mass_change;     ///< the net mass change for the peptide
  int num_mods;           ///< the number of items in the list_of_mods
  int aa_mod_counts[MAX_AA_MODS]; ///< the number of each kind of aa mod
                                  ///as listed in parameter.c
};
</pre>

The num_mods field is the number of AA_MODs in this peptide mod.  It
is the sum of aa_mod_counts[i] for i in (0,MAX_AA_MODS]. The index in
aa_mod_counts is the same as that in the global list kept by
parameter.c.  So if aa_mods_counts[0] == 2 it means this peptide mod
has two of the first stored aa mod.  mass_change is the sum of the
masses times the count.

  Differential Mods<br>
  Author: Aaron Klammer<br>

  <br>
Here is a list of requirements for the implementation of differential modifications in Crux: 
<ul>
<li> Differential modification types will be specified in the parameter file by triplets:
<ul>
<li> A mass offset (float)
<li> A list of amino acids where the modification can occur (string)
<li> A maximum number of this type of modification per peptide (int)
</ul>
<li> A single amino acid may have multiple modifications of different types, but only one of the same type.
<li> A single analysis will allow at most 11 
different types of modifications. The numer 11 is fixed and
not-user specified.
<li> Peptide N-term and C-term modifications will be allowed. The
constraints will be the same as for internal amino acids, i.e. multiple
modifications of different types will be allowed, but only one modification
of the same type.
<li> Protein N-term and C-term modifications will be allowed. Again, constraints
on number and type of modification will be the same as for internal amino
acids.
<li> Some N-term mods will only be allowed on peptides with an N-term
within a parameter controlled distance of the protein N-term.
<li> To avoid exponential explosion, there will be a maximum number of
modified peptides generated from any unmodified peptide specified by the
user (e.g.  1000).
Modifications will be enumerated from lowest number of total modifications
per peptide to highest. The enumeration of modified peptides for 
an unmodified peptide will stop if the next largest number
of modifications will push the total number of modified peptides
above the maximum value.
<li> A potential efficiency in enumerating peptides can be gained by scoring
low modification peptides first and only proceeding to high modification
peptides if the low modification scores are below some threshold.
This will be implemented after implementation of 
the core differential modification functionality. 

</ul>
