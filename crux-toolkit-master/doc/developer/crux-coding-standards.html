<title>Crux: Coding standards</title>
<body>
<blockquote>

<h1>Coding standards</h1>

<h3>Lint checking</h3>
<p>
As of spring 2016, we began using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpplint">cpplint</a> to perform style/lint checking on our code base. Because it had built in a number of agreeable standards (from the <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">Google style guide</a>) we decided to incorporate many into our own. We've done this in two groups: lenient rules (for the legacy code with existing errors) and strict rules (the desired standard). The lint checker (<code>cruxlint.sh</code>) runs on one file at a time and takes the flag <code>-l</code> for lenient style checking. For example:
</p>
<pre>
     test/lint/cruxlint.sh -l src/app/CruxApplication.cpp
</pre>
<p>
The new rules (some of which are common sense) are as follow (quotes come from the Google style guide or internal <code>cpplint.py</code> documentation). If you have a complaint or confusion about a rule, please checkout the Google style guide (which goes into more detail) or examine <code>cpplint.py</code>. Rule categories can be modified through the files <code>include_rules.txt</code>,<code>include_lax_rules.txt</code>, and <code>exclude_rules.txt</code> in <code>test/lint</code>.
</p>
<h4>Lenient rule/checks:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>class -- All c++ classes must be declared completely.</li>
  <li>c++11 -- Our code runs c++11. This means no future features, such as r value references</li>
  <li>deprecated -- No deprecated functions. For example: &quot;&lt;? and &gt;? (max and min) operators are non-standard and deprecated.&quot;</li>
  <li>utf-8 -- Non ASCII characters should use UTF-8 formatting</li>
  <li>invalid increment -- checks for invalid increment. For example if <code>count</code> is a pointer, <code>*count++</code> &quot;is invalid, because it effectively does count++, moving pointer, and should be replaced with ++*count, (*count)++ or *count += 1&quot;</li>
  <li>memset -- &quot;Checks for potential memset bugs like memset(buf, sizeof(buf), 0)&quot;</li>
  <li>printf format -- Dissallows printf formats allowed by gcc-2, but which are non-standard</li>
  <li> printf -- Checks for format string bugs. The second argument of <code>sprintf</code> should not be literal. Use <code>sizeof</code> instead.</li>
  <li>threadsafe function -- Suggests use of thread safe functions in correct places (such as POSIX)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Strict rules/checks:</h4>
<ul>
  <li> explicit_make_pair -- &quot;For C++11-compatibility, omit template arguments from make_pair OR use pair directly OR if appropriate, construct a pair directly&quot;</li>
  <li> storage_class -- &quot;Storage class (static, extern, typedef, etc) should be first.&quot;</li>
  <li> casting -- Don't use c-style casts</li>
  <li> function -- &quot;All parameters should be named in a function&quot;</li>
  <li> inheritance -- Don't include redundant virtuals</li>
  <li> namespace -- &quot;Namespace should be terminated with "// namespace&quot; SOME_NACESPACE_NAME</li>
  <li> nolint -- <code>cpplint</code> results in some false positives. &quot;False positives can be ignored by putting // NOLINT at the end of the line or // NOLINTNEXTLINE in the previous line.&quot;</li>
  <li> nul -- Don't include a nul byte. These are problimatic for some tools</li>
  <li> casting -- Don't use c-style casts or take the address of a cast (because c++ uses temporary variables for these)</li>
  <li> explicit -- &quot;onstructors callable with one argument should be marked explicit.&quot;</li>
  <li> indentation_namespace -- Do not indent inside of a namespace</li>
  <li> init -- Checks if a member variable is initialized within itself</li>
  <li> int -- &quot;use a precise-width integer type from <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>, such as <code>int16_t</code>.&quot; </li>
  <li> operator -- &quot;Unary <code>operator&amp;</code> is dangerous.  Do not use it.&quot;</li>
  <li> references -- &quot;All parameters passed by reference must be labeled const.&quot; </li>
  <li> whitespace checks -- cpplint includes various whitespace checks which agree with those already required by this style guide. For example, spaces around operators. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Objects in C</h3>

<p>
Crux underwent a transition from C to C++.  For the
remaining C code, we aim to produce modularized code, with each module
acting like a C++ object.  In particular, a
<code>struct</code> object should be encapsulated in a pair of
<code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code> files.  The fields of the struct
should only appear in the <code>.c</code> file, and the
<code>.h</code> file should provide access routines of the form
<code>get_&lt;object&gt;_&lt;field&gt;</code> and
<code>set_&lt;object&gt;_&lt;field&gt;</code>.  Each module should
also provide <code>new_&lt;object&gt;</code>,
<code>free_&lt;object&gt;</code> and <code>print_&lt;object&gt;</code>
functions.
</p>
<p>
For the portion of crux written in C++, classes should be split
between .h and .cpp files with declarations in the .h files and the 
definitions in the .cpp files.  Member variables should be declared as
private or protected with get and set functions as necessary.
</p>


<h3>Syntactic standards</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Insert a space after every comma.</li>

<li>
Insert a space around arithmetic operators.</li>

<li>
Do not separate variable names and the arrow operator (<code>-&gt;</code>)
with a space.</li>

<li>
Use no more than eight parameters per function.</li>

<li>
If a function call doesn't fit on one line, place each argument on a
separate line.  For example:

<pre>
  foo(
    parameter1,
    parameter2,
    parameter3,
    parameter4,
    parameter5
  );
</pre>
</li>

<li>
When an actual parameter list contains a constant (e.g, "true"), that
constant should be followed by a comment that indicates the formal
parameter name.</li>

<li>
Use underscores, rather than internal capitalization, to separate
multi-word variable and (non-class-member) function names.</li>

<li>
Use a single trailing underscore for class member variables.</li>

<li>
Indent two characters per level.  Note that, within emacs, this
indentation can be automatically achieved by appending the following
comment at the end of the file

<pre>
/*
 * Local Variables:
 * mode: c
 * c-basic-offset: 2
 * End:
 */
</pre>

This comment should be included in every <code>.cpp</code>
and <code>.h</code> file.</p>

<p>
In vim this is set by including the line 

<pre>
set tabstop=2
</pre>

in your .vimrc file.</li>

<li>
Make each line at most 80 characters wide.</li>

<li>
Configure your editor to use spaces rather then tabs for indentation.
In emacs this is done by setting <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  In vim this is set by including the line

<pre>
set expandtab
</pre>

in your .vimrc file.</li>

<li>
Follow the keywords <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, etc. by a
brace on the same line.  Do not leave off the braces, even for a
single-line block.</li>

<li>
Place each end brace on a line of its own.</li>

<li>
The keyword <code>else</code> may optionally "cuddle" between two
braces:
<pre>
  } else {
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Use parentheses to make expression precedence explicit.</li>

<li>
When an expression continues over more then one line,
begin the continuation line with an operator whenever possible.
For example:

<pre>
  foo = param1 + param2 + param3
    + param4 + param5;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
When a fixed string assignment continues over more then one line,
take advantage of ANSI C's implicit concatenation:

<pre>
  string = "this is a really long string"
    " that runs over two lines";
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Do not use single-letter variable names.</li>

<li>
Name loop indices using <code>&lt;name&gt;_idx</code>.</li>

<li>
Name loop iterators using <code>&lt;name&gt;_itr</code>.</li>

<li>
Use only the following allowed abbreviations:
<ul>

<li>
num  = number

<li>
cur  = current

<li>
src  = source (e.g. when copying)

<li>
dest = destination (e.g. when copying)

<li>
db   = database

<li>
min = minimum 

<li>
max = maximum

<li>
mz = mass-to-charge

</ul>

<li>
Define variables anywhere within a block.</li>

<li>
Use all lowercase characters.  The only exceptions are constants,
enumerated types (see below) and macros, which are written in all
uppercase.  Class methods should begin with a lowercase letter and 
capitalize multiple words (i.e. camel case).</li>

<li>
Use <code>static const &lt;type&gt;</code> to define constants rather
than <code>#define</code>.</li>

<li>
Name files with the class name as it is written
(e.g. PeptideIterator.h).</li>

<li>
Usage statements should conform to the following:
  <ul>
    <li> All options should have '--' not '-'.</li>
    <li> Use periods consistently at the end of option descriptions.</li>
    <li> Put '(Default = XX)' or '(default = XX )' to indicate default
    behavior.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>
Routines that return a status indicator should use zero to indicate
success and a non-zero value to indicate failure of some kind.</li>

<li>
Use <code>/*  */</code> comment style only for multi-line comments.
Use <code>// </code> comment style for single-line comments, with a space 
after the <code>//</code>.

<li>
Enumerated types should be defined in all caps as
<code>&lt;type&gt;_T</code>. Values of the type should also be in all
caps, with names like <code>&lt;name&gt;_&lt;type&gt;</code>.  Following all of 
the legal values should be <code>NUM_&lt;name&gt;_TYPES</code>, which can be
used to enumerate through all of the types.  The last value should be
<code>INVALID_&lt;type&gt;</code>.  All <code>if</code> 
and <code>case</code> statements that handle the type should handle all
values.  <code>case</code> statements should have an explicit case
for <code>INVALID</code> and <code>NUM_TYPES</code> rather than
using <code>default</code>.</li>

<li>
C class-like structs should be named in all caps as 
<code>&lt;name&gt;_T</code>.  C++ classes should be named with internal 
capitalization as in <code>ClassName</code>.</li>

<li>
Known deviations from the coding standards and other bugs were previously
indicated with a one-line comment like this:
<pre>
// FIXME (WSN 19-Dec-05): Create access routines for this module.
</pre>
We now strongly prefer the creation of issues in the issue tracker. </li>

<li>
Use <code>FLOAT_T</code> to declare floating point variables rather then
<code>float</code>. This allows us to switch to double precision
arithmetic throughout Crux by specifying
the <code>--enable-doubles</code> configure option.</li>

<li>
Do not write messages directly to <code>stderr</code>.  Always use
the <code>carp()</code> function to report information, warnings, and
errors.</li>

<li>
Do not call <code>exit()</code> directly for fatal errors.
Use <code>carp(CARP_FATAL, ...)</code>.  This will report a fatal
error and call <code>exit(1)</code>.</li>

<li>
If you find yourself making small changes in a file that doesn't meet
these coding standards, write your changes in the existing style of
the file.  If you are making a substantial revision to the file, take
the time to bring the entire file into conformance with these
standards.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Structured comments</h3>

<p>
Crux previously used <a
href='http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html'>doxygen</a> to
produce documentation directly from structured comments in the source
code. Even though we have abandoned the use of doxygen, please still try
to leave informative comments on methods and in difficult to understand
portions of your code.</p>

<p>
Generally please try to follow these standards related to structured
comments:</p>

<ul>

<li>
Begin each file with a header of the following form:
<PRE>
/**
 * \file foo.c
 * AUTHOR: Elmer Fudd
 * CREATE DATE: December 31, 1999
 * \brief Insert brief description of file contents here.
 *
 **/
</PRE>

<li>
Precede each function definition with a block comment.  The comment
should give a brief description of the function, as well as describing
the input and output parameters and side effects.</li>

<li>
Function parameters lists should begin with input parameters, followed
by input/output parameters, followed by output parameters.  In the
formal parameter list, each parameter should be followed by a one-line
explanatory comment.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Command line standards</h3>

<ul>

<li>
All command lines should be of the following form:

<pre>
     crux command [options] arg1 arg2
</pre>

where <code>arg1 arg2</code> are required arguments.  Obviously, the
number of required arguments will differ by program, but every program
will have at least one required argument.</li>

<li>
Command line option names should be verbose, and should be preceded
with a double hyphen.</li>

<li>
Multi-word command line options should have internal hyphens.</li>

<li>
Where it makes sense, a hyphen on the command line in place of a file
name should be interpreted to mean "read from standard input."  Where
this is possible, it should be documented.</li>

<li>
Every program should provide a <code>--verbose</code>
option that controls the verbosity of messages to standard error and a
<code>--parameter-file</code> option that allows additional parameters
to be specified via a file.</li>

<li>
The usage message should list the default value for every option.</li>

</ul>

<h3>SVN standards</h3>
<ul>
<li>
During development many files will be generated that won't be
tracked in version control. SVN will recognize the files that aren't being
tracked and alert you to their presence by showing a status of '?'.
In many cases the files are completely innocuous and will never be added to
version control.
In fact, it would be better not to have them cluttering up your SVN output.
SVN can track a list of file names or regular expressions that should be
ignored via the <code>propset svn:ignore</code> command.
To avoid clobbering each other's list of ignorable files we will record the
names and patterns to be ignored in a .svnignore file for each directory.
To add or remove a name or pattern just edit the .svnignore file and run:
<pre>
svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore .
svn commit -m "Updated list of files ignored by SVN" .svnignore .
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
