 <h2 align=center>Notes on releasing new versions of Crux</h2>

<p><i>Note: A detailed <a href=#todo>checklist</a> is at the bottom of
    this page</i>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
After every successful commit to the Crux GitHub repository
our TeamCity server automatically publishes the current source distribution
and binaries for all platforms to the Crux web site.
As functionality milestones are achieved
we also publish stable, versioned releases.
This document describes how to publish a versioned release.

<h3>Before you begin</h3>
<p>Consider updating the UNIMOD data: download the latest data in XML format from
  <code>http://www.unimode.org/xml/unimod.xml</code>. Then, run <code>bin/unimod_parser.py
  /path/to/xml/file &gt; src/model/Unimod.h.</code>

<p>Confirm that the TeamCity server successfully built Crux from the current
  repository trunk on all platforms, and that the smoke and performance tests all 
  passed on the 64-bit Linux build.
  Update the release notes
  (<code>doc/user/release-notes.html</code>), and update the PHP script to point at the
  new packages (<code>doc/user/download/download.php</code>).

<h3>Version numbers</h3>
<p>Each time new files are made available for download, the version
number should increment by 0.01 for minor releases or by 0.1 for major
releases. The version number is maintained in CMakeLists.txt in the
root Crux directory in the lines
<pre>
set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "X")
set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "XX")
</pre>
This controls the numbering of packages and what is reported by the 
<code>--version</code> option.
</p>
<p>Update <code>doc/user/download/download.php</code> to point at the new
versions of the distribution packages.</p>
<p>Commit these changes to the trunk.</p>

<h3>Create a branch for the release</h3>
<p>
Because each numbered release of Crux will require some changes to the source,
a branch should be created for each release.
Bugs in the release are fixed in this branch and then
merged into the default branch.
<p/>
For example:
<pre>
# Get latest code from remote origin
git pull
# Create branch for bug fixes to release
git checkout -b crux-3.2
</pre>
<h3>Prepare a static tarball of Proteowizard</h3>
The normal build of Crux pulls the latest version of Proteowizard 
from it's TeamCity repository.
This is a moving target, and may result in bugs or build breaks
as the Proteowizard team makes changes. 
For numbered releases we download the current version of Proteowizard
and save it into as a static tarball on our web site.
When users build the release from source, this tarball is downloaded,
and used to build the Proteowizard libraries.
<p/>
The script <code>ext/download-pwiz-tarball.sh</code>
can be used to download a copy of the Proteowizard source tarball
into the current directory.
It can then be copied into the download directory for the new release on the
<code>crux-toolkit</code> download web site, which is on
<code>noble-web</code> on the GS network.
The Crux download directory is under the Noble Lab website,
in <code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads</code>.
<h3>Modify the Crux build to use the new Proteowizard tarball.</h3>
This is done by editing <code>ext\CMakeLists.txt.</code>
Look for blocks of code  in the clauses depending
on <code>USE_LATEST_PWIZ</code>.
There will be two such blocks, one for Windows, and one for non-Windows.
Change these blocks to use only the Proteowizard tarball on the Crux web site.
Note that this edit should <b>not</b> be merged back into the trunk.
<h3>Modify the Crux build to use a fixed version of Percolator</h3>
In <code>ext/CMakeLists.txt</code> set the CMake varible <code>PERCOLATOR_GIT_VERSION</code>
to the tag for the current release of Percolator.
For example:
<pre>
SET(PERCOLATOR_GIT_VERSION "rel-3-02")
</pre>
<h3>Add TeamCity build tasks for the new version</h3>
You'll need to create TeamCity tasks for building the new version of
Crux on each of the platforms,
and for deploying the results to the web site.
The easiest way to do this is to copy the tasks for the previous named release
and then modify them with the new version and directory information.
<p />
For the platform build tasks, the settings that need to be changed include:
<ul>
<li>
General Settings
<ul>
<li>
Name
</li>
<li>
Build configuration ID
</li>
<li>
Artifact Paths
</li>
</ul>
<li>Version Control Settings</li>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Edit Name
<ul>
<li>VCS root name</li>
<li>VCS root ID</li>
<li>URL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Build Steps</li>
<ul>
<li>
Update the name of the packages generated in the build.
For example, change <code>crux-3.1.Darwin.x86_64.zip</code>
to <code>crux-3.2.Darwin.x86_64.zip</code></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p />
For the web site deployment task, the settings that need to be changed include:
<ul>
<li>General Settings</li>
<ul>
<li>Build configuration ID</li>
<li>Build counter</li>
</ul>
<li>
Build Step: SSH Deployer
<ul>
<li>
Edit Deploy Artifacts build step
<ul>
<li>
Target path under Deployment Targets.
</li>
<li>Artifacts path under Deployment Source</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Dependencies
<ul>
<li>Modify the dependencies to point at the tasks for the builds of the new
version for each platform.</li>
<li>Update the artifact dependencies with the new names of the artifacts (zip files and tarballs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Before running the TeamCity tasks,
<a href="crux-sourceforge.html" >log on</a> to the <code>crux-toolkit</code> server.
Create a subdirectory for the new release in 
<code>/home/project-web/cruxtoolkit/htdocs/download</code>
<h3>Build the releases and update the web site</h3>
Once the previous steps have been completed run the TeamCity task to
deploy the new version to the web site. This will also run the
tasks to build the new release for each platform.
<h3>Verify the deployment to the web site</h3>
You should verify that the web site content has been correctly updated.
You should also download and test the distribution for each platform.
