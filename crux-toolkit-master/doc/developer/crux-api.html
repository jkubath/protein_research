<ul>

<li>
<b>amino_acid</b>: A single amino acid, with three properties: type,
mass and a list of chemical modifications.

<li>
<b>chemical_modification</b>: A modification to an amino acid.  It has
two properties: name (e.g., acetylation, water-loss, etc.) and mass
offset.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/peptide_8h.html">peptide</a></b>: A string of amino acids, with properties such as
length, charge (possibly "unknown"), mass, and mass-to-charge.  The
function <code>get_proteins</code> returns a list of proteins in which
the peptide occurs.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/protein_8h.html">protein</a></b>
: A longer string of amino acids. 

<li>
<b>database</b>: An unordered set of peptides.  The primary function
is <code>read_database</code>, which reads the database from a given
input file.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/peptide__iterator_8h.html">peptide_iterator</a></b>: An object for traversing the
peptides in a database.  This object may iterate over only the peptides
within a specified mass-to-charge range.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/ion_8h.html">ion</a></b>
A (fragment) ion of a peptide, with a pointer to the
originating peptide. In addition to mass
the ion has four properties: ion type (b or y), 
cleavage location, charge, a list of chemical modifications (i.e.
neutral loss). 

<li>
<b><a href="./html/ion__series_8h.html">ion-series</a></b>
A series of fragment ions.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/peak_8h.html">peak</a></b>: A single peak in a mass spectrum, with two properties:
mass-to-charge and intensity.  The peak also has a (possibly empty)
list of associated ions.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/spectrum_8h.html">spectrum</a></b>: A collection of peaks and some other identifying spectrum
information.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/spectrum_8h.html">peak_iterator</a></b>: An object for traversing the peaks in a spectrum.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/spectrum__collection_8h.html">spectrum_collection</a></b>: A collection of spectra.

<li>
<b><a href="./html/spectrum__collection_8h.html">spectrum_iterator</a></b>: 
An object for traversing the spectra in a spectrum_collection.

<li>
<b>peptide_spectrum_match</b>: A spectrum and an associated peptide.

<li>
<b>psm_score_function</b>: A generic scoring routine for
peptide_spectrum_matches.  Takes as input (1) a SCORE_FUNCTION_T
object that specifies the type of score function to be applied, and
(2) a single peptide_spectrum_match.  Returns a numeric score.
