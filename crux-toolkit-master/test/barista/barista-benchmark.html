<h1>Barista benchmark test</h1>

<p>
This test checks how well the barista works on increasing samples of 
ms2 data.  The data used comes from increasing in size subsets
<code>/net/noble/vol1/data/crux-datasets/2013wu-variation/</code>,
specifically the <code>ms2-centroid</code> spectra. The test runs
barista on the spectra after each subset is run through tide-search
with low resolution and exact p-value. The exact run specifications
are shown in <code>./setup.sh</code>. The performance of barista
according to time and max memory usage is shown against the number of
input spectra. To change the data set used for benchmarking, one need
only modify <code>./setup.sh</code> <code>./*_job.sh</code> to change
the <code>tide search</code> parameters and location of input files.
</p>

<p>
You can execute the test by running the
script <code>./dispatch.sh</code> in this directory, which will dispatch
a number of jobs to the <code>uge</code> noblelab cluster. After these
jobs finish, you can run <code>summarize.py</code> (also in this directory)
to parse the output (which currently goes to <code>~/barista_benchmark/</code>).
Assuming that you have gnuplot installed, then your plots should show
up in the right-hand set of plots below. </p>
