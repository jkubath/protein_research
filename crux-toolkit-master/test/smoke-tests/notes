NOTES on development of smoke testing

October 24, 2007

Currently implemented are the following tests (not in this order).

generate_peptides:
  use fasta	default
		sorted by mass, uniq
		sorted by length, uniq
		sorted lexical, uniq
		
  use index	default

get_ms2_spectrum:
	one scan number that exists

create_index:
	default

search_spectrum:
	one spectrum (scan 6), standard2.fasta

search_spectra:
	test.ms2, standard2.fasta

match_search_analysis:
	test.ms2, standard2.fasta

Working with code checked out from 2007/10/08, there is a segmentation
fault with generate_peptides using the index. The error is resolved if
I remake the index using no parameters (with the parameters in the
crux-test.cmds command it still fails).  match_search gives a seg
fault without other output for either index.

Working with the code checked out today (2007/10/24), I get a seg
fault from the first test.  For now, I will be working with the 10/08
code. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments

Add the ability to include a #-comment and blank line in the
crux-test.cmd file.  Change crux-test.pl.  Done.

Add comments to crux-test.cmds to describe fields and give info about
specific tests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now working with the 10/26 version

Changed crux-test.pl to no longer take the file|index|analysis entry
in the command file.  Additional functionality from this is replaced
by adding rm commands to the string before the test command (as in rm
-rf test_crux_index; create_index ...) and by running two tests for
create index (a create index test followed by a generate_peptides
command).  

Added an ingore string entry to the command file.  This will introduce
a -I 'regex' option into the diff command so that, for example,
changes in time won't show up as a failed test.  Full command syntax
is now name = output file = command = ignore string.  The ignore
string must be a series of regular expressions encased in single
quotes.  Example: name = file = do this = 'Time' 'server m*'

Added some tests to crux-test.cmds.  Now tested are generate_peptides,
get_ms2_spec, match_search, match_analysis all with and without index
(except analyze matches which only works with an index)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
November 1, 2007

Before adding more tests, I would like to change the makefile (and
then the smoke commands) to reflect the new executable names.  Since
create_index is currently broken at the head of the revision tree, I
will continue to work with the 10/26 version.  I should be able to
merge the changes into the current version later.  

This is done and checked into head as version 1.92.  Appears to work
with clean checkout.

Change the smoke tests to be able to test an index without having to
build it.  Rename an existing fasta, make an index and be sure not to
delete it in any of the test commands. Test generate_peptides and
match-search with existing index.  Test match_analysis with existing
index AND existing results

The crux commands are checked in as version 1.19.  I haven't added the
index or the results to the repository yet.  Full test works with code
version 10/26.  In current version match_analysis seg faults on existing
index and existing results.  Create_index segfaults before giving
other output.

Change the names of the executables in the smoke test.  This is done
and checked in as version 1.20.  The test runs correctly (with 10/26
code, recent makefile) even with the links to old names removed.

December 5, 2007

Current version of code works with the current commands in
crux-test.cmds (there are some legacy discrepencies in output).
Create-index has had it's parameter/option handling updated but no
other apps have.  As a result, some of the default tests require a
parameter file because of a bug that will be fixed with the parameter
handling updates.

December 6, 2007

There are inconsistencies between ranunculus and methionine with
precision and sorting.

Generate-peptides rounds the value of masses differently between the
two comptuters.  If the precision is extended out to more than 2
places, it is clear that all of the discrepencies are x.xx48 to
x.xx50.  I don't know a good way to deal with this.  Aaron thinks that
peptides on the cusp shouldn't be in the smoke tests.  I don't see an
easy way to eliminate them.  One possibility would be to post-process
the output files and take off the final digit in the masses.  

When generate-peptides sorts by mass, the order within a mass is not
consistent.  Aaron thinks that there should be secondary sort
(lexical).  This should also be applied to sort by length (maybe it
already is?)

Also, generate_peptides could not use the existing index (one created
on ranunculus) but search-for-matches could.  I thought the existing
index worked for Aaron on methianine, as well.

ON INSPECTION:
Some of the problems with sorting may  not be clear from the output
files because the differences in mass are smaller than what is
printed.  However, when printed to 6 places it is perplexing that two
peptides with the same aa composition can have different masses.  Two
peptides on ranunculus will have exactly the same mass (to 6 digits)
and not have the same mass on methonine.  So even if mass ties are
broken by lexical order, there are different peptides that tie on the
two machines.  For now, comment out the tie-breaking code in
sorter.c::compareTo(). 

The thing to do is figure out how to deal with the small differences
in masses. 




TODO: 
* exapand tests to involve more options
(after code supports these)
* remove param file from default runs
* organize inputs into sub dirs
* organize outputs (including indexes) into sub dirs



---------------------------------------------------------------------
New tests

* Generate Peptides:  
WE DO test
 with and without parameter file
 with and without sequence
 with cleavages tryptic, partial, and all
 with and without missed cleavages
 sorted none, mass, length, lexical
 uniq 
 with and without index
 change min/max mass
 change min/max length
 with average and mono-isotopic masses
 output trypticity
 command line override params file

WE COULD test
 redundant

* Create index
WE DO test
 with parameter file
 cleavages all
 average isotopic masses
 redundant and uniq peptides per prot
 that it works with generate_peptides

WE COULD test
 without parameter file
 change min/max mass/length
 cleavages partial/tryptic
 missed cleavages

 that it works with search (this done for some, do for all?)

* Search for Matches
WE DO test
 fasta and index input
 output into cwd
 sqt and binary output
 sqt to default name
 xcorr scoring
 two decoy's
 searching all charge states
 no ops/no param file

WE COULD test
 output into different directory
 only sqt and/or only binary output
 sqt to given name
 decoy sqt
 change min/max m/z spec cutoff
 xcorr_logp/sp_logp scoring
 no or >2 decoys
 searching only one charge state

* Analyze Matches
WE DO test
 percolator
 no parameter file
 
WE COULD test
 retention czar and/or both
 with parameter file
 printing a feature file (what is this?)

* Get ms2 spectrum
WE DO test
 one spec that exists
 outputing stats

WE COULD test
 appending to/replacing output file


ALSO
 inputs from different sources full and rel paths
 predict-peptide-ions
 score-peptide-spectrum

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes: 

GENERATE PEPTIDES
different masses than original test file
different ordering than original test file (function of diff masses?)
redundant sequences does not seem to be functional (should be default,
option does not seem to change it)
if option not found, does not exit non-zero


ANALYZE MATCHES
fix output 
doesn't work with only fasta
